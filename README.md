# AI Ethics Expert Assistant

This Chainlit application serves as an AI Ethics Expert Assistant, leveraging key documents on AI ethics and governance.

The app is containerized and will run automatically on Hugging Face Spaces.

# AI Ethics Expert Assistant

This project implements an AI-powered chatbot that serves as an AI Ethics Expert Assistant. It uses Chainlit for the chat interface, LangChain for the language model integration, and vector storage for efficient retrieval.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface powered by Chainlit
- Retrieval-augmented generation using LangChain
- Based on two key documents:
  1. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights
  2. NIST AI Risk Management Framework

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the AI Ethics Expert Assistant through the chat interface. Ask questions about AI ethics, rights, and risk management based on the loaded documents.

Example questions:
- What are the key principles in the AI Bill of Rights?
- How does the NIST framework approach AI risk management?
- What safeguards are recommended for AI systems?
- How should AI systems protect user privacy?

## Deployment

This application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using Docker. The necessary configuration is included in the Dockerfile and this README.
